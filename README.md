# TestingFramework
A small demo project of how to build a testing framework using C# and Selenium.
This project contains Three simple smoke tests on the website http://www.watchepisodeseries.com/.

In addition I've used Two frameworks called BDDfy and Shouldly.
In short, BDDfy comes from BDD which means behavior driven development. This framework allows me to add output text on top of my tests that in turn will help me read the outcome of the test in a more friendly and concise way without even having to read the code itself.

Shouldly is an assertion framework which gives me better error messages when an assertion fails. Simple as that.

Feel free to have a look at the code and use/modify/refactor it for your specific web testing solution.
